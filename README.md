# CXIMB
## A Cluster X-ray Image Morphology Basis

CXIMB (pronouced: ksee-em-bee) is a simple python package for evaluating the model introduced by Benyas et al. **(citation TBD)**; please cite appropriately if you use it.

Minimal documentation is provided in the docstrings in the code (`cximb.py`) as well as a walkthrough in `demo.ipynb`.
